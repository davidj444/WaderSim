```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

I need to edit all the functions in utils.r into one function call which has all the parameters in, and produces the data that I would need to run a GLM with two treatments on each simulation, and put in the plots comparing actual productivity with estimated productivity.

Then I need to change the plots that are underneath the page where you set parameters.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
